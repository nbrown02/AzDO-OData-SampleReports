## Connectivity
* Open the .pbit file
* Select http/https (only choose http if your Azure DevOps Server is HTTP)
* Add the Analytics / Azure DevOps Server URL - for Azure DevOps services enter 'analytics.dev.azure.com' / for Azure DevOps Server enter your server details
* Add your organization and project name

Don't confuse the team name with the project name, a common mistake. If the URL you use is "http://dev.azure.com/Microsoft-UK/AzureDevOpsTeam/Database", then Microsoft-UK is the Organization Name, AzureDevOpsTeam is the Project name, Database is the team name.

* It should then look something like this:
